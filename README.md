# 🛒 Sales Forecasting Project

This project predicts future sales using **Machine Learning** and presents the results in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessed and cleaned sales data  
- Built a LightGBM regression model  
- Added lag features and rolling averages for better forecasting  
- Evaluated model performance (RMSE, MAE)  
- Exported predictions to CSV for visualization in Power BI  

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- Compare **Actual vs Predicted Sales** (line chart)  
- View sales trends by **date, month, weekday**  
- Track key error metrics (RMSE, MAE)  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and generate predictions.  
2. A file `sales_forecast_results.csv` will be created.  
3. Import this CSV into Power BI to view the dashboard.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI
