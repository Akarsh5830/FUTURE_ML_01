This project is about building a simple **sales forecasting model** using Python and LightGBM.  
The goal is to predict future sales based on past sales data, with some basic feature engineering.

---

## 🗂 Project Structure

- **Sales_Forecast_HumanStyle.ipynb** → Main Jupyter notebook (step-by-step, human-style explanation)
- **sales_forecast_model.joblib** → Trained LightGBM pipeline saved for reuse
- **data/** → Put your dataset CSV file here (e.g. `submission.csv`)

---

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook

1. **Load Data**  
   Load a CSV file containing sales data (must have at least a `date` column and a `sales` column).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Check shape, missing values, datatypes  
   - Basic descriptive statistics  

3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Convert date column to datetime  
   - Aggregate sales to daily level (if needed)  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Add time features (day, month, weekday, etc.)  
   - Create lag features (previous sales values)  
   - Create rolling averages (7-day, 14-day)  

5. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Last 30 days are used for testing  
   - Rest of the data is used for training  

6. **Modeling**  
   - LightGBM Regressor inside a scikit-learn pipeline (with scaling)  
   - Evaluate with RMSE, MAE, MAPE  

7. **Visualization**  
   - Plot actual vs predicted sales for the test period  

8. **Save Model**  
   - Save trained model as `sales_forecast_model.joblib` for deployment

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place your dataset CSV file inside `/mnt/data` or the project folder.  
   Make sure it has at least:  
   - `date` column (datetime format)  
   - `sales` column (numeric target)  

2. Open **Sales_Forecast_HumanStyle.ipynb** in Jupyter/Colab.  

3. Change the `DATA_PATH`, `DATE_COL`, and `TARGET` variables if your file uses different column names.  

4. Run all cells step by step.

## ✅ Next Improvements

- Add external features (promotions, holidays, store info).  
- Try hyperparameter tuning for LightGBM.  
- Experiment with Prophet / ARIMA / Deep Learning models.  
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasting.
